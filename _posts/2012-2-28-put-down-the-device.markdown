Some good points on distraction at meetings. I see people looking at their laptops checking their email, checking their phone for the latest notification that pops up on the screen. I have been guilty of this at times. You know what? It's pretty rude. When someone is speaking, should we not listen? I've become more aware of this since my boss called us out at a meeting to close our laptops.

Unfortunately, we are distracted at social gatherings, dinners, even casually watching a movie with your significant other at home.

Instead of exclaiming how well we "multi-task" maybe we should start to single task.
