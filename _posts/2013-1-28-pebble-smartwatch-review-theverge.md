[Nilay Patel from the Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/28/3924904/pebble-smartwatch-review) was able to review the Pebble smartwatch.

It's taken quite awhile for the Pebble team to start shipping these watches but is it worth the wait? It seems like a yes and no from the review. The app development isn't there yet and the iOS integration seems okay. I'll reserve my judgment until my device arrives and I can do a small review.
