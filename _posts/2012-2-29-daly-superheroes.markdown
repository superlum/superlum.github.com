I had no idea Tim Daly had a web comedy series with his son, Sam Daly. If you're a geek, you know that Tim Daly is the voice of Superman. In this episode, he apparently has a little trouble letting go of playing Superman. Fortunately, Nathan Fillion (voiced Green Lantern in the last two DC animated flicks) is here to help.
