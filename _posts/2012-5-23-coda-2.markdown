This makes me a very happy developer. I've been waiting for this for a long time.

Some features that I'm excited about:

+ Code folding
+ iCloud syncing
+ Git
+ Visual tabs
+ Automatic indentation

I will definitely try out [Diet Coda](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/diet-coda/id500906297?mt=8 "Diet Coda") for live preview on my iPad and on the go code editing.
