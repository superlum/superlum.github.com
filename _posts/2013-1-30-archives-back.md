title: "Archives and RSS are back"

I hope the last few nights were worth all the trouble of fixing the RSS feed and getting my archive page up.

I did not know that plugins were disabled on Github Pages so I wasted a day and a half researching why the plugin I was using did not publish my archive page on Github but I could see it locally on my machine.

I have to thank [Scott Parker's post on Jekyll](http://spparker.com/posts/2011-04-26-keeping-jekyll-classy) and looking at his github repo for reference.

My checklist so far for this blog plus a couple of more things:
- Archiving posts (DONE)
- Updating layout. I am happy how it is but I always like to tweak things
- RSS feed. I need to test this to make sure it works (DONE)
- Site search
- Images
- Pagination (DONE)
